		generic = Recent advances made by [0] scientists have called into question several commonly held beliefs about [2]. By collecting [1] data directly from [2] using a [3] they could further advance our understanding of this celestial body.
		
		generic = Using a [3], the scientists at [0] would like you to take a spacecraft to [2] and collect [1] data there. They are willing to reward you handsomely for such a task and to provide some initial Funds for your use.

A generous up-front payment will be made to help finance this mission and a payout will be received upon successful delivery of the scientific data.
		
		survey = You have been given a proposal for a survey mission plan conceived by the scientists at [0]. They request that you collect various [1] scientific observations while at [2]. Funding will be provided along with a payment for any scientific data collected and returned to the [0] agency.
		
		survey = Noting a distinct lack of information about [2] the scientists at [0] have begun planning a mission to gather several scientific observations. They have tasked you with designing a spacecraft capable of reaching [2] and conducting various scientific experiments. Funds will be provided to help begin this mission and rewards will be given for any data recovered from [2]

Funds will be provided to purchase the necessary scientific instruments needed to carry out this survey, and payment will be rewarded upon receipt of the results.

		biological = Recent observations from Kerbin have raised the possibility that [1] may have once supported simple forms of organic life. The scientists at [0] have asked you to plan and carry out a mission to study [1] using a variety of scientific instruments designed to determine if there are any signs of past biological activity. The successful recovery of scientific results from this mission will be of great value to [0] and you will be rewarded accordingly.

		biological = Scientists on Kerbin have long postulated that [1] may have once been capable of harboring life. Now [0] has proposed a mission to study [1] by collecting several scientific observations; results from this mission will be analyzed closely and will certainly shed more light on [1]'s history and any potential life that it may have supported.
