	InSpace = An accurate recording of this planet's reflected solar irradiance is collected.
	InSpace = Measurements from a wide range of UV to IR wavelengths provide details about this planet's composition and characteristics.
 
	KerbinInSpace = Kerbin's ocean covered surface results in a fairly low visible light albedo, and its thick atmosphere absorbs most UV and near-IR light.
	KerbinInSpace = Complete measurements are made of Kerbin's reflected solar irradiance; perhaps long-term recordings of such data will reveal the impact on Kerbin's climate of the near constant rocket launches made from the planet's surface...

	MunInSpace = The reflective regolith on the Mun's surface gives the moon a very high albedo in most of the UV to near-IR range.

	MinmusInSpace = The bright surface of Minmus reflects most visible and IR light; the far-IR channel records only a weak signal though, indicating that there is no internal geological activity to produce such thermal emissions.

	SunInSpace = The sun is continuously emitting light at all recorded wavelengths, nearly overwhelming the sensors.
	
	MohoInSpace = Close proximity to the sun results in high absolute levels of irradiance despite Moho's relatively dark surface and IR-absorbing characteristics.

	GillyInSpace = Gilly's featureless surface reflects little visible and IR light; a result of its dark surface and IR-absorbing, silicate-rich surface.

	DunaInSpace = Strong UV and shortwave IR absorption by Duna's atmosphere suggests the presence of high levels of Carbon Dioxide and possibly Ozone.
	DunaInSpace = Duna's bright polar regions reflect most visible light, giving the planet a high overall albedo.

	LaytheInSpace = Significant long wavelength IR signals are detected during scans of Laythe; these are typically a sign of internal thermal emissions due to geological activity. 

	VallInSpace = Vall's bright surface and lack of a thick atmosphere allow for most incident radiation to be reflected; only a few dips are present in the UV channels, signaling the presence of UV-absorbing water ice on the surface.
	
	TyloInSpace = Tylo's very bright surface reflects most visible and UV light, giving the moon a very high overall albedo.
	
	BopInSpace = Bop presents a curiously high level of intermittent near- and far-IR emissions; its distance from the sun and lack of any geological activity would seem to rule out any simple explanations for such phenomena...

	PolInSpace = The visible light channel detects only a modest signal, but the UV and IR radiometers measure very high levels of reflected light from Pol's surface.

	EelooInSpace = Eeloo's nearly white surface reflects nearly all UV, visible and IR light, ruling out the possibility of water ice. Perhaps the surface is coated with something more interesting...
