		AsteroidSrfLandedClassA = Many weak seismic reflections are detected from several directions, indicating that this tiny asteroid is composed of loosely packed, stony material.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassA = Only diffuse, scattered seismic waves are detected from this small asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassB = Vibrations from the spacecraft are still detectable on this asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassB = Several strong, but highly localized seismic reflections are detected, suggesting the presence of small veins of metallic minerals.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassC = Seismic waves quickly diffuse through the interior of this asteroid, this suggests that it is primarily composed of loosely packed materials.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassC = Faint seismic reflections are detected from the disturbance created by the spacecraft grappling the asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassD = Very strong seismic waves are detected, along with several weak signals, suggesting that the asteroid has a dense, metallic interior underneath a loosely packed surface.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassD = Localized, strong seismic reflections suggest that this asteroid has a dense, metallic interior.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassE = Several distinct seismic waves are reflected from the interior of this large asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassE = The strong seismic reflections detected from within this asteroid likely originate from veins of metallic minerals.

		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassA = There is no detectable level of gravitational field in the vicinity of this tiny asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassB = Only the gravitational background signal is detected near this small asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassC = Detectable gravitational field fluctuations are recorded in the area near this asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassD = A faint gravitational signal is recorded while making a close pass of this large asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassE = A significant gravitational signal is detected from this enormous, dense asteroid.

		AsteroidSrfLandedClassA = Nothing above the background gravitational field is detected from the surface of this little asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassB = Faint gravitational fluctuations are detected from this asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassC = A weak, evenly distributed gravitational field is detected emanating from this mid-sized asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassD = Large fluctuations in the gravitational field suggest that this asteroid's interior is composed of minerals of varied densities. 
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassE = A large uniform gravitational field suggests that this asteroid is composed mostly of dense, metallic minerals.

{
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassA = The goo behaves normally, obviously not sensing the tiny asteroid nearby.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassB = Slight electrical currents are detected on the surface of the containment pod, the goo inside seems somehow responsible.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassC = The goo forms a slowly pulsing sphere suspended in the middle of the containment pod, growing larger as the asteroid gets closer.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassD = The goo takes on a smooth metallic sheen, maybe the nearby asteroid is metallic too.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowClassE = The goo begins rapidly vibrating, possibly sensing the presence of a large asteroid nearby.

		AsteroidSrfLandedClassA = The goo begins to turn a sandy brown color, mimicking the surface of the asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassB = The goo slides onto the side of the container facing the asteroid, clearly attracted to it somehow.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassC = The goo begins to make curious squeaking sounds, almost as if it's trying to communicate with something in the asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassD = The goo takes on a lumpy, almost spherical shape, eerily similar to that of the asteroid.
		AsteroidSrfLandedClassE = The containment pod rattles around after the goo inside starts violently expanding and contracting.
